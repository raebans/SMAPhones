Input Data/Data Inforamtion Types: 
    1. Extension/Name

    3. Call Duration

Data Feild Types: 
    1. IntergerFeild or CharFeild (Interger/Text)
        This is numerical, but we want the numbers to coorispond to names, so the feild should either start as an IntergerFeild and tie to a CharFeild, or should be a CharFeild from the begining.
    2. Boolean
        This is going to function like a "true" "false" output. It is either Incoming, or Outgoing.
    3. DateFeild or DateTimeField
        We want this to act like a timestamp. 

Constraints: 
    1. Max extension is 3 digits, the max character name should be 20
    2. This is only going to have Incoming Outgoing
    3. This should have Date, and Time spent on call. Not time of Day.
